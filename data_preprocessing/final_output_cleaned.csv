They checked various places in the system but couldn't find a clear explanation. The team suggested adding a password to the standard completion option to prevent human error, but this was deemed impractical due to frequent use.

A new VAT matrix was set up for 'SIE' type customers and suppliers with a VAT code of 'SIE'. A test order was created to verify the VAT rate applied correctly. To resolve an added complication, an entry was added to the VAT matrix for stock and service type 'SZ' with account type 'SIE', assigning a VAT code of 'SIE'.

They cleared some spools and then obtained permission from the user to delete the remaining spools. The user had previously tried clearing the spools but was still experiencing issues.

t6UJ9A00FMOB,You want to remove and suspend a large number of unused nominal codes in Sage without manually going into each code and ticking the suspend option.,"The support team suggested a possible solution to suspend multiple nominal codes by updating the status in the database. They mentioned that a script could be written in SQL to achieve this, but it's outside the scope of the support contract. However, the customer is proficient in SQL and could potentially make the changes themselves.

However, this still didn't resolve the issue. Further investigation revealed that the current balance was including the opening balance again.
