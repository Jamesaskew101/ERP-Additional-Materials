The query was modified to use the date the invoice was entered into as the cut-off rather than the financial period it posted to. This was done by changing the condition from 'i.plyear = '2026' and i.period = '01'' to 'h.date_entered between '2025-01-01' and '2025-01-31''.

t6UJ9A00G3E0,"We need to disable the automatic printing of sales orders.
