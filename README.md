## Model Usage and License

This project is built on top of **Meta’s LLaMA 3.2** model family.  
The base model weights are **not included** in this repository.  
They must be obtained separately from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) or [Meta’s LLaMA download page](https://www.llama.com/llama-downloads/) after requesting access and agreeing to Meta’s terms.  

We provide only:
- **Training and evaluation code** to reproduce the experiments.  

### License Terms

- LLaMA 3.2 is released under the **LLaMA Community License Agreement** (September 25, 2024).  
- Full license text: [LLaMA 3.2 Community License Agreement (PDF)](https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/LLAMA_32_3B_INSTRUCT-license.pdf)  
- Under Section 2 of this license:  
  - If your product or service (including affiliates) has **fewer than 700 million monthly active users (MAU)**, you may use, modify, fine-tune, and deploy LLaMA 3.2 under the community license.  
  - If your MAU exceeds **700 million**, you must request a separate license from Meta before deployment.  

This repository and its contents are therefore suitable for **academic research** and for **commercial use cases under 700M MAU**, provided all other license terms are followed (e.g. attribution, branding, and Meta’s Acceptable Use Policy).
