The support team checked the financial summary for last year and found it to be in balance. They then checked this year's summary and also found it to be in balance. The team was asked to close the adjustment period for 2024, but found a 1p difference. A journal entry was suggested to correct the difference. The adjustment period was closed, but the system still showed a 0.01p difference.

The customer requested a summary table (TB) for year level 4, period O to A, but then changed their request to a full TB for the year 2022. However, the system can only produce tables for the current and previous years.

During year-end close, the balance sheet is not balancing with the general ledger (TB) due to a discrepancy of 0.07p.","assistant

The issue was resolved by journaling a small amount to balance the accounts. The solution involved debiting the balance sheet and crediting the profit and loss account. The specific accounts used for the journal were 3-10-200 and 2-80-100. A 0.01p journal was processed to correct the discrepancy, which was initially 0.07p out. After the journal was processed, the year-end close was completed successfully.

The 2023 opening balance was incorrectly set to £670.31 instead of £0.04, affecting the 2023 closing balance and the 2024 opening balance. The 2024 opening balance should be £11.92, but the current forward balance is -£658.43. The issue needs to be resolved to correct the 2024 opening balance.","assistant

The support team connected to the system to investigate the issue. They found that the problem was with the opening balance figure for FY22, which was showing as 0.00 but was actually 670.35. The team explained that the issue was due to the system's limitations in displaying figures for balance sheet accounts beyond the current and next fiscal years. A potential solution was suggested, but the customer decided to wait for further confirmation from their Financial Controller before making any changes. The issue was eventually closed after the customer confirmed resolution.",3,S1000v4,0.5847759,0.6005498,t6UJ9A00GG98,3.0,S1000v4,"The issue was resolved by adjusting the 2024 opening balance to £11.92, correcting the discrepancy and ensuring accurate financial records.",t6UJ9A00GG98,"The 2024 adjustment period needs to be closed, but there is a 1p discrepancy in the Total Balance (TB).",3,S1000v4,"The support team checked the financial summary for last year and found it to be in balance.

Sage ERP 1000 v4.0.9 requires Java version 8 update 381 to function properly. Upgrading to a newer Java version causes Sage to malfunction. This is a known issue. To resolve the vulnerability, a workaround is needed to prevent Sage from being affected by the Java update.","assistant

The issue was resolved by recommending an upgrade to the latest service packs for Sage 1000 V3 and V4. For V3, the recommended service pack is SP12, which supports versions 1.8.0_144 to 1.8.0_191. For V4, the recommended service pack is SP9, which supports versions 1.8.0_144 to 1.8.0_191. Alternatively, a 64-bit version can be installed, which will work with the latest patch.

The issue was investigated by checking the date format on the document.

The issue is that the system is incorrectly formatting the due dates for January invoices as 2/3/25 instead of 28/02/25. This suggests a date format mismatch, where the system is interpreting the month and day values incorrectly.","assistant

The due date for invoices is automatically adjusted if the credit category assigned to the customer is 30 days from the end of the month. This is because February has 28 days, so adding 30 days would normally put the due date in March, not February. The due date can be manually changed using the 'override' option, but this only affects when the invoice is flagged as overdue, not the original document.

The issue was with a small discrepancy in the balance sheet, showing a difference of 0.01. It was initially thought to be a system issue, but it was later determined that the problem was due to rounding in Excel. The team decided to proceed with the year-end process and monitor if the system objects to the small discrepancy. If issues arise, a one-sided journal may be entered to correct the balance. The team will keep an eye on the situation and close the ticket for now, but be available for further assistance if needed.","{""Urgency Code"": 3, ""Category"": ""S1000v4"", ""Resolution"": ""The issue was resolved by journaling a small amount to balance the accounts.""}","assistant

A one-sided journal was posted to balance the sheet accounts. The journal was for +0.01 and was dated 31/10/23 with a specific posting code. This allowed the General Ledger year-end procedure to run successfully. The necessary parameters for the year-end procedure were set to NLPERIOD = 01 and NLYEAR = 23. A journal batch posting was also required, and a colleague will run an opening balance transaction batch to ensure it matches the closing transaction batch.",3,S1000v4,0.6142117,"assistant
