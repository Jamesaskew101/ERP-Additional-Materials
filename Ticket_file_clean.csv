Please see print screen for example. The total cost is 10,424.99 for the Qty of 12. However, the report shows that 2 Qty have been finished but this has not been reduced this from the full amount.


 

This print screen shows the journal that has been posted in the month based of the stock history. The full for the WO  comes back to 10,574.64 giving a difference of 149.65 and we are trying to understand how we have this difference from the stock history to the .

Can you look into this issue raised by  please? 


Thanks,
 


Hi 

This order is live on SAGE, but going to use this one as a test.

 process the order, as a b2b, everything appears ok with the order, if a change is needed to the order, CS go back in and make the change, the comments on the dd line can be seen by us, but when  processes the purchase order, no comments are showing in dd line.
 then has to ask CS if we want the b2b po deleting, we can try and enter comments again, but they still don't appear on 's po, we then arrange for the complete order to be deleted and reinput as a brand new order.

Example
 processed  with A4 warehouse, not b2b, so using  own stocks.
 was requested to change the order and use supplier stocks, so  would have changed the warehouse code to A1 b2b, entered comments in the dd line, but when  processes the po, no comments are seen in the dd line.

This has been going on for years, at least 10.

So there is an awful lot of disruption,  having to delete several po's,  having to put replacement orders on, the department doing same work twice .
For every order for audit purposes we need saved in order filing:-
Customer po
PDF of the order processed on SAGE
Order sent for checking and that email saying order has been checked into order filing

So the above is duplicated when we encounter the problems mentioned above.

Once this has been looked into, we will need to delete this order off SAGE etc.

Thanks","and her team have not yet run through the work around, any issues with the work around please reference this call.

Where a line has been deleted and re-entered in  were finding comments were not sent through. Working with  and  we have tried to work a work around.
Work around:
Check the line number in  the comments they need are before the affected order line they will delete the comments.
Unsure if User then needs to come out to suspend the order as  had an odd issue where loading the comment didn;t update the front end.
Go to the last line and command Sage to enter a new order line
Put * in the warehouse
Press the F3 button to launch the .
Load the comments as required.
Exit and Confirm the Order, Sage should then update the Purchase order with the required comment lines.

Subject: New VAT codes in SAGE

Hi ,

Is this something for support? 

We are currently testing the process of entering invoices into Sage with the help of PL-Batch. We are experiencing issues with entering car expenses using codes 82R, 82V, 88R and 88V. These codes have VAT deduction limitations, which makes it impossible to enter them via batch processing. I would like to ask if it is possible to create 4 new codes in Sage without automatic VAT calculation, similar to code 82Z.

Thanks,","Had teams meeting with  and  and advised on creating vat codes with zero rate for 82Band 82C in preston EU and Fox belg same setup as 82Z
 to get back if having any further queries"

t6UJ9A00GGWQ,CentralSupportingFiles,M04 IE VAT data,3,",

Please see below and attached (we have manually fixed this today).

We are having issues with a certain product having 0% VAT charged on it when invoiced under the IE VAT number. This product needs to have 23% VAT charged to it each time it is invoiced under the IE VAT number.

Is there a flag you can apply to this product that applies 23% VAT on the line when it is invoiced under the IE VAT number?

The current treatment of this product under the GB VAT number needs to remain unchanged.

Many thanks,",We have now changed the VAT code in the VAT  for the ZERO / IEVAT from Z to ESV and it appears to have fixed the issue.

t6UJ9A00GBL0,,,1,"I have a general query in relation to the current Sage nominal structure. 
Currently our nominal structure is divided into four section   e.g. ML-121-IC-230 (ML R&D IMPROVE MATERIALS).

Staff within both the R&D and Instrumentation departments want to be able to enter costs against specific projects. Currently we just record costs (post invoices) against nominals for a general area such as R&D Uri or R&D molecular.

Is there anyway that we could differentiate projects within the current nominal structure so say one project would be ML-121-IC-230-01  with another project being  ML-121-IC-230-02 etc.

We could create new nominals but ideally we wanted subset nominals so all projects for  R&D URI would come under say ML-117-IC-216 and this would appear in the P&L in total but within ML-117-IC-216 there would be a way of recording costs against different projects.","Had teams call with  and Jonathan

At this point, I noticed that the amount given on Sage was different to what was on the figures that I had originally created, so wanted to speak with my collegue in Treasury about it, before I went any further.
 
My colleague was on lunch, so I waited, and, therefore, Sage timed out.
 
I then wanted to go back into that batch, so entered the batch number which didn't work. I tried to create a new batch number, but it said that the file wasn't there.
 
I then went to check that the '01' batch, which it said it wasn't there, so I then tried to create a new one, but it said that the 'payment file already exits'.
 
I then tried to create a new generate payments from lists, and it said that the file didn't exist.
 
I looked in modify and '01' batch was there, but I couldn't modify or delete it, which then meant I couldn't create a new batch on '01'.

PRODUCING A REPORT AND JOURNAL

Complete the following:

Journal description. Type in a description, up to 20-characters, for this journal posting. Otherwise, leave this field blank.

Journal period. The period number to which this posting belongs is displayed. This is controlled by the system key STPERDISP. If STPERDISP is set to YES, the period number stored in the system key STPERIOD is shown; if STPERDISP is set to NO, the period number stored in the system key NLPERIOD is shown. The period number can be amended if required.

Journal number. Journal numbers cannot begin with the letters R, S or T as these are used to signify special journal types. If the system key NLSEQJRN is set to:


STPERDISP is not set in  but if set to YES would use  the value of STPERIOD, else NO would default to the value of NLPERIOD – we could change this to YES if you want?


Therefore, you would need to check and amend if necessary, the period the journal to be posted to before posting it."

We have another example of this issue, please see below:

To reopen the topic about invoicing, and give a more recent example; FOX EU has SK1038A as a delivery account which should invoice to SK1038B. However some invoices are created on SK1038A.
The most recent example here would be order  created on SK1038A which is expected to be invoiced to SK1038B but created on SK1038A.
I suppose this will be something when creating the orders, so possibly it is worth involving Cindy from Sales admin if something is going wrong there.


Are you able to investigate this please?

Thanks,","I have checked and according to , the invoice customer is set to SK1038A. Sage states this was raised from  due to being backordered, as the invoice customer is also SK1038A in this order Sage will have copied this when the back order was created.
The earliest order for customer SK1038A which has the invoice customer is  from 04/02/2025.
Unfortunately, Sage auditing isn’t enabled for the customer file or the order header, it looks like customer SK1038A had the invoice account amended just before 04/02/2025 (All orders before then were going through with the invoice customer as SK1038A and after non backordered orders are showing SK1038B).

 utilities i.e. the API framework, programmed client automation (e.g. via ), , Graphical MPS,  and AutoQ require direct access to the system. Using client automation All the software needed to run client automation is installed by the  installer on the server or the  installer on the client. You need to set two registry keys for the user that will run the automated client, the keys are in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry hive.
SOFTWARE\Sage\CSClient\Automation\URL
SOFTWARE\Sage\CSClient\Automation\UsingWeb
The URL will be typically set to http://localhost/webclient. The UsingWeb key is set by default to y(es). If you log in as a different user, then you will need to set up the registry keys for that user.
Automation UUID The automaton CSDriver.dll in normal use will create a unique registry value under HKCU/ SOFTWARE/Sage/CSClient/LaunchUUID.
These values are deleted when the client closes. However, if the client is terminated, or crashes, then the key value is not removed and there can be a build-up of obsolete values. These can be safely deleted from the registry if needed"

I have written a breakdown:

Once the back order is raised, I cannot amend the allocated qty to 0 as you seem to have done – or indeed change back to the full amount – you just the get the ‘Line has Back-Order’ warning message as I would expect - and you cannot amend the Qty at all.

Now I can see the qty’s were changed within a minute or so at the time of processing, so I suspect some kind of communication/network error at the time to allow this to have happened.
Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do regarding this order, and I have to put it down to a network glitch at that time that meant an update somewhere did not complete.
The logs and audit do not offer any help as to any errors at the time but do confirm the qty was changed to 0 and then the back order changed from 12 to 14 for some reason.

We have credit postings on our balance sheet for which represent goods we have received but there has been no debit posting to the balance sheet code to match off the transaction.  
 
We now have over £204,000 of credit balances within the balance sheet code (09-95-950-7) which are over 12 months old.
 
Given the age of the transactions it is unlikely we will receive an invoice to match these credits. We suspect, but are unable to prove, that either the goods receipt was ""unreceipted"" or an invoice was received without the correct detail therefore prohibiting the matching process.
 
We are investigating how to post a double entry which posts a debit to the cvode 09-95-950-7, the purpose of this debit would be to match the aged credit balance, and a credit to the PL; releasing the benefit in this financial year. 
 
We have attempted to ""delete"" and ""receipt"" the old purchase order within the purchase order processing module of Sage; however, we have been unable to track the subsequent accounting entries within Sage. 
 
Would you be able to provide guidance/assistance as to how this process can be completed?","e standard process in Sage would be to process an invoice in order to close the order and remove it from the bespoke GRNI report. This is impractical. Sage does have an option that will flag the order as closed but no G/L postings are made.
 
I would suggest that manually flagging the orders will remove them from the reports but you will need to post a manual G/L journal to remove the values from the GRNI account. 
 
 
 
This option simply flags poheadm.status as &#8216;C&#8217;. It does correct the on-order quantities on the stockm table so if you change the status is SQL you may need to resolve the on_order_qty by running a stock recalc if required."

I hope you are well.

Could you tell me what would take precedence for the invoice customer setup.

Company: 
: HUDF02
: HUDF01

In the  screen both accounts are set up identically, same email address, same options ticked etc.
The only difference in set up is HUDF02 has invoice customer set to HUDF01 in slcustm.
Would the invoice customer in slcustm overwrite anything that is set in the enhance screen?

We are having complaints lately that the invoice customer isn't also invoiced correctly and sometimes it uses the delivery customer, an example order is /8, but this all looks correct in terms of set up from what I can see.

When we book invoices sometimes we use VAT code 88H. This code is for suppliers outside Belgium. There, reverse charge VAT applies. That means VAT 0 is 0. But we have to report 21% VAT on 2 different VAT accounts. once with '+' and then '- '
So the entry should look like this:

BE-65-5-000 - 100.00 - 88H - G
ZZ-41-1-862 - 21.00 - 88H - V
ZZ-45-1-862 - 21.00 - 88H – V

The last line we have to add manually. If we use code 88H, Sage calculates only the first line ZZ-41-1-862 - with amount of 21%. We enter account ZZ-45-1-862 with negative amount ourselves.

We are doing a piece of work to transfer the stock held in the TESGL stock system to the  stock system.  As part of this we have run a  report in  and have noticed that the balance on this is £167,104.29 compared to an expected balance of £55,597.51, which is made up of three stock receipts posted into  on  .  

On review it appears that stock balances were included in the set up of the  system, but the TB value was £0.  

Is it possible to remove the balances that were included in the set up in error?  We can't post a stock adjustment because this will write off £111,506.78 value of stock to the P&L but it was never in the TB in the first place.  So if we post this adjustment the stock value in 10-30-1060 will be wrong (currently it matches the  report in TESGL + what we expect the  report in  to show).

t6UJ9A00G21H,Bill of Materials,Is it possible to ask if Sage has a function to update costings on BOM material?,3,Is it possible to ask if Sage has a function to update costings on BOM material?,"Hi ,
Sage has a  program in the Bill of 
 
:
To recalculate the bill of materials costs:
1	Leave the field Explosion level as x to calculate costs for every level of a bill of materials (assembly) from the components in the final bill down to the components of the lowest subassembly, that is, raw materials level. Alternatively, type:

•	s to calculate the total cost for each inventory item at the assembly header level only. (This does not include the components that make up the assembly.)
•	a number between 1 and 99 to calculate costs for assemblies to a selected depth, i.e. from the components in the final assembly down to the components in the level entered here.
When a subassembly is used in the selection, the subassembly is regarded as being at the highest level. This must be taken into account when defining the explosion level.
2	The following checkboxes are available if your system is set up to use BOM / & Alts.:
•	Cost BOM supersessions. Leave this checkbox ticked to use the costs from active supersession assemblies in the revaluation. Clear this checkbox if you do not want supersession assemblies to be included in the costs.
•	Alternative routes. Leave this checkbox ticked to include the alternative routes, including supersession routes, in the calculations. Clear this checkbox if you do not want the alternative routes to be included in the costs.
3	You can recalculate the bill of materials costs based on an alternative cost to the cost defined in the system key STCOSTTYPE if your system is set up to use , BOM &  and/or BOM / & Alts.. The default value for the field Costing method is determined by the value of STCOSTTYPE. To recalculate costs, in Costing method, select one of the following:
•	Current costs for stock items
•	Expected costs for stock items
•	Standard cost for stock items.
4	Select one of the following codes in the field Apply percentage uplifts to indicate to which items a cost percentage uplift is to be applied:
•	Both
•	Manufactured
•	Purchased.
5	You can specify whether you want to include labour and overhead costs from the Assembly and/or Routing tables in the calculations. This is only applicable if you use Work in Progress and system key BMMATBREAK is set to YES, i.e. the standard cost of your inventory items is obtained from the sum of the cost categories materials, labour, overhead and outwork (subcontract work) rather than using a single total cost.

To determine which costs to use in the calculations type one of the following in the field Labour and overhead:
•	From assembly file to include labour and overhead costs from the Assembly table.
•	From both assembly and routing file to include labour and overhead costs from both the Assembly and the Routing tables.
•	From neither assembly nor routing file if you do not want to include labour and overhead costs in your calculations.
•	From routing file to include labour and overhead costs from the Routing table.
 	
If your system is set up to use BOM / & Alts. and:
•	the Cost BOM supersessions and Alternative routes checkboxes are ticked and
•	the field Labour and overhead set to r or b, i.e. labour and overhead costs from the Routing table are to be included,
when an active supersession assembly is used in the cost revaluation, the route costs are taken from the Default route code defined on the Bill of Material to  table (via the option ).

This might be the standard route or a supersession route. If a default route has not been defined for a supersession assembly, the route defined for the master assembly is used (with the supersession route used where it exists).

6	You can now:
•	Recalculate the bill of materials costs and update these costs to the Stock table ? select CR-Accept.
•	Specify ranges for the recalculation ? select F6-Select.
7	The number of records updated is displayed. Select CR-Ok to clear the message.

TIP	
•	When you have updated your standard costs you can run the  report to check the costs for your inventory items.
•	An active supersession – assembly or route – is determined by the system date.
•	Purchased components, i.e. components that have the Make or buy? flag on the stock record set to B, are not included in the calculated costs."

t6UJ9A00G24I,,Currency issue/query,3,"Good morning all

I hope you can help me figure this one out

Background:
We processed an order  on a Euro account code ILLUMINA and the product costs on the account converted to euros as a standard. The sell prices don't convert as a standard. We understand the reason for sage having to convert the costs for us is because the PO cost values have to be in GBP, so sage somehow converts the costs to Euros for us to ensure the cost and sells are both in the same currency on the sales order to ensure the revenue calculation is correct (otherwise we'd have GBP cost and Euro sell)

We always key foreign currency sell prices in manually as we know that sage does not convert for us

Issue:
We had a scenario where we needed to credit the above order number on a euro account. Given we know that the costs converted, we understood the process to be that we had to key the costs into the credit as GBP in the exact same way as we did on the sales order. However upon releasing the credit, we noticed that the costs did not convert. Do we know why this might be?

Is it because credits are not linked to a PO, so wont ever need to convert like they do on a sales order, and so all credits have to be keyed in the correct currency value? If so, would this be the case for both credit types, value only and non-value only (non-value only being the ones which release stock back to the sage warehouse)

The related credit was CN019835

Resolve: depending on the decision on the above, we then need to understand how best to correct the credit, which now has the wrong values on it. 

I hope this is all ok, and you can help me unpick this issue.

I'm having issues with security groups that have been created based on a 'parent security group'.  My report only shows me the options for the user based on their security group, not the setting in the parent security group.

Security group Fin_PL has a parent security group of Fin_MA.
When I pull the allowed options for Fin_PL, it doesn't show the allowed options that it takes from Fin_MA.
I know the users who have security group Fin_PL assigned to them are allowed create and amend access to PL create & amend suppliers, but my report does not show this.

I have a question about our 'new ' invoice bespoke. A while ago we moved over to a new invoicing method which reads the credit_category from the order header rather than doing the standard look up against the customer file at the point of invoicing. We have had a request from the sales team to change the payment terms for anything EXCRED that is still in status 2,3,4,5, for last year. On the face of it, it seems like this might be achievable by updating the credit categories on the order header however, there are mixed credit categories for EXCRED orders and so I am guessing this bespoke does not apply to them in the same way? Could we get clarification on that please. 

Is it possible to amend the due dates on the EXCRED orders in opheadm and have that correctly pull through at the point of invoicing?

We're looking for a way to massupdate the terms to 60 days to save the sales team doing this all by the front end.

 

Are you please able to advise?

Thanks,","When the invoice prints, it populates the due date based on the credit category.

As part of the monthly process I match the movement quantity (field called: movement_quantity), and the standard cost as set for that period (we have a monthly process on the first working day of the new calendar month when we set the standard cost applicable to that month) to arrive at the value that needs to be posted to account for the stock moved in the period.

However there is another field in that table called movement_cost that is similar in value to the standard cost, but never actually the same.
Can you please check what is the process of populating it so we can understand the significance of this field.

The reason why this specific question came up was during our internal audit.
Please see extract of the movement report that caused the investigation, along with the invoice. Q38349, PO , prod code BDAPU375.

Rate in the system at the time of the movement was 1.146:","R- 03/01/2025 11:31:07 (GMT )

As you can see from the above, a credit note has been raised for GRAPETREE  -  CN186175

Then on the 17/10/24 a credit note was raised for DIET IMPORTS.    The final number on this credit note was 408 but when the credit note line was first inputted they have raised it for 660 and then gone back into the line and amended it to 408.  The consequence of this is that the system has then done a minus to take the stock back out BUT it has taken it from lots of random credit notes and left the batch quantity for DIET IMPORT at 660 because on the 31/10/24 I have cleared that batch down.

Is there any way of setting they system to make sure when it does the RC/N that it takes it from the original batch it was raised on because this is causing some real issues when trying to tie up credit notes and put stock away.","- 30/12/2024 15:34:26 (GMT )

We have an issue which we have always had with regards to licences for Sage and not having enough available.

In the UAR table it shows both time opened and last activity this is always the same.

The taskkill.bat file looks for applications open 10 hours ago and before on that day.  This we can alter for by reducing the value to less than 10.  This can risk closing of users currently in options doing things on the system.

Is their a way that the process ID can be looked up on the server to see when it was last active.  Not sure where  stores this sort of information if at all or whether it can be queried or not.  We could then say anything open from sage that has not been active for say 20 minutes then the process can be killed.

Is this possible or is there a way of updating the UAR table with this information.

We have noticed an issue in our current accounting system. It allows purchase invoices for inventory to be posted without a goods received note (GRN). This means invoices can be recorded even if the receipt of goods has not been confirmed.

In our previous Sage 500 system, the posting of invoices was restricted until the GRN was available. This control helped prevent:

	Posting errors or duplicates.
	Overpayment for goods not received.
	Mismatches between inventory and financial records.

To illustrate the issue, I have attached an invoice as an example. In this case, the goods have not been received, but the invoice has been posted for the full amount.

We see this as a potential risk and would appreciate your guidance on possible solutions. Is there a way to configure the system to ensure GRN confirmation is required before invoice posting? If not, what alternative measures would you recommend to manage this risk?

Good morning.
 
From our discussion with Diane on the invoice processing process, we understand that Sage 1000 has been set up to change the status of an invoice from status 4 to status 7 when the order is dispatched. The status of the order subsequently changes to 8 when the order is invoice. 
Also, Sage has been set up to allow the processing of invoices only when an order has been dispatched (that is status 7).
 
Kindly confirm whether these features of Sage 1000 are embedded functionalities within the application that cannot be changed by any user from the front end of Sage 1000.

The alternative is a massive amount of manual work so we thought we'd ask the question.","Unfortunately once a tax document has been raised the date cannot be changed.

You can alter the due date on the  item using the ‘’ option but this doesn’t change the date on the document. I’m happy to talk you though changing the due date in opheadm so the invoice can be reprinted if this will help.?"

However, there was a glitch in Mainfreights system when it was picked (Mainfreight have confirmed that it was a glitch their side). This meant that one line of stock, instead of being picked fully from C1 which was requested, it was split across C1 and C2 stock.
As the order files then didn't match from our side on Sage, compared to Mainfreight, this flagged on the system and we received an .
I have gone back into the order and tried various different things to align the orders, and re-run the order, but it keeps coming back as an error.
(Including:
	Moving the 2 Lots that were allocated both into C1 and manually allocating the picked lots
	Creating a second line for the SKU, allocating the lots
	Soft allocating the stock

I have since tried sending the order re-down to Mainfreight. Getting them to re-run the order (but not repick it). They have sent me the new SFTP file, which now matches the order on Sage. However, the order still errors and does not move to status 6.  confirming that all the files their side match. So I'm at a bit of a loss now
Please can I get some support in how we can get this order moved through?
The main goals are to ensure that the stock is aligned correctly and the customer receives an invoice for the order they have already received.","The incoming file although it did split products, was still going against Line 7 of the .
A few attempted fixes failed, a quick call was then carried out where it was determined a new line was added but the file was still looking at line 7.

t6UJ9A00FX5G,,Picking lists default warehouse value,3,",

I needed to default the warehouse filters to 92 to 92 when running a pick list when using 'range'.  I did this in Sage 1000  as shown.  This does work when we run pick lists in 'Range' option.  However, when we want to create a pick list for an 'individual' order, this is not picked up.  Note that the order we are trying to pick is using warehouse 03.

I reverted the setting I made so the warehouse is blank for the 'between' and 'and' value and now the individual order pick list works.

How can I default the warehouse values only for 'ranges'?  Or, when running individual orders, show the warehouse field so we can change to 03 if needed?

formstozl does point to Zebra_Large
 
The unprintable area I assume might be causing the issue, however the “Paper format“ is several times larger than what it should be.
I would recommend removing the unprintable area, but I would have expected the  to be as John mentioned (I don’t have experience with the smaller Zebra LP Printers, only the larger industrial Z/S series printers. This would cause printing on multiple labels on Z/S series Zebra printers).
 
To set this, on the Sage server launch “”
Go to  ? vmbtprsagappp01 ?  click “Zebra_Large”
Click “…”
 
I would first zero the “” ? “Right” and “Apply”
 
Retry printing to see if this works."

Having spoke to Emma, we believe this is due to OCA11 is not sent via EDI, therefore on the Customer side they don't have an EDI set up, but it has been ticked in Sage to send via EDI when i shouldn't. I have since unticked the EDI box in Sage for OCA11, but the batch is still stuck. Is there a way I can remove OCA11 invoice: OP/I336085 from this batch, for the other invoices to send?
Also if I can remove the invoice from the EDI batch, will it still process onto Sage, or will the order need to be redone?
On the below, could you just delete the one line for OCA11 so we can still send the remainder of the batch? – As deleting the whole batch will affect the M&S and Tesco line too and they need to receive invoices via EDI.
 
If this is not possible to do, would Cindercone/Datel know how we resend the other lines via edi once the batch has been deleted?

t6UJ9A00FTV8,,Burgess F6 website notional stock & invoicing,3,"Following on from previous work I have a couple of items for you

To recap we work with one of our customers to supply direct to end user customers via our website.  The customer (BLAC01 Blackcat in our sales ledger) sends direct to end user customer out of their stock which they have already purchased from us.  We then need to credit them for this stock and account (invoice) for the higher value sale to end user.

We do this from a weekly activity report from our website.  As a rule, the invoice and credit will be issued Monday/Tuesday in week after the actual sales.  We need to date these in the week of activity.  For example, sales week Monday 7th Oct – Friday 11th Oct, invoice and credit physically issued say Tuesday 15th Oct but they must be dated Friday 11th Oct for reporting reasons.  This is actioned in our F6 warehouse using notional stock as the movements cancel out in volume

We can action this for the invoices by keying the details in sales order entry& invoicing > tasks- orders > sales invoice once all keyed we do not print directly in this function but make a note of the order number.  We then generate/print the invoice by Invoice  & credit print by limiting the run to the specific order number, in doing this we can redate the invoice and tick the hold box in the print function which retains the invoice so we can view the invoice again via the sales ledger transaction.   The method does not work for the credit we need to issue

1)	Credit note dating issue & hold tick 
a.	We create the credit in sales credits
b.	Generate / print via Invoice & Credit print , redate to the previous Friday.
c.	On printing we do not have the option to tick hold 
d.	The credit note printed is a white copy and not our normal paperless format
e.	As we have not ticked hold we cannot view the credit note via the sales ledger transactions.

Can you look into 
	Amending so the credit prints can tick hold
	The view function to be available via transactions

2)	The initial notional stock was set up by Datel, I believe via the stock take function movement reference C97443
a.	We have new stock to action in this process.
b.	I have added stock via sundry stock adjustment 
i.	Movement reference number C98135
c.	This stock is not available as free stock as part the invoice / credit actions above

Can you 
	Check the C98135 as why it is not available
	Show us how to use the stock take function to load notional stock assuming this a better method (as you used it)

I have an issue when I'm trying to print PO's or invoices. 

When I have just raised a PO or Invoice it works fine (I use dbself) and it is emailed to me as normal. 

However if I need to go back and re-print the PO or invoice it wont work anymore.

It was previously working when I did this – I'd go in to the PO or Invoice, on Sage, that I was trying to reprint and use 'dbself' and it would email them to me but this has suddenly stopped working.

To clarify – when I initially raise one (and as long as I don't go out of the relevant screens) it works ok. Its just when I have to go out of sage and back in again  (for what ever reason), or if one requires re-printing.

On the PL, the transactions on their account shows newest to oldest – so when you are looking for something you can see it straight away. As usually you would be looking for something recent.

Is there a way this can be changed on SAGE so that it shows the current first for the sales ledger (customer transactions)?

I have checked that the PO has not been completed, but not sure where else to look.  Could you please assist?  I'm not sure if it's an issue with how the PO is being raised or how an invoice is being processed, or something else entirely!","Connected to investigate and identified that outstanding commitment no longer existed  podetm dispayed an original order qty of 0 and a local total expected cost of 49946.77 (total of 2 grns) with an actual of .01.  Appears that the 'more to come' or Complete box has been ticked when processing the S/C valuation so system has updated podetm to indicate there is nothing further to be processed against this line and as we have actuals far in excess of commitment, this is possibly the reason for no commitment showing.

We’ve tested and due to the way the Sage system is configured the Range and Batch WO closure can’t be carried out without adding the stock to the system. As we have discussed previously this can be worked around by updating the status flag on the  header to C and then running the archive completed works order routine and then running the stock re-calc option for the whole warehouse F1.

The works orders are dated from June 2011 to the current date (26/09/2024 at the time of writing), please can you confirm a cut-off date where no updates would be carried out. i.e. 1 month, 2 months retained from the date the work is planned to be carried out?

To do this, we’ve identified the following steps:-

1, Backup the existing Demo database
2, Backup the existing live database
3, copy the live database into the Demo database
4, Run several SQL scripts to identify and confirm the numbers of each works order and each status
5, Update the Works order header status (demo)
6, Run the archive WO routine to confirm time required to run (demo)
7, Run the stock re-calc option for the F1 warehouse
8, Re-run the SQL queries to check the number of WO and their status
9, Update the works order status by SQL scripts (Live database)
10, Run the  archive Live database (Please note this will require downtime of the system)
11, Run the stock re-calc routine again will require system downtime whilst being carried out

We then received 144 in August

30 were booked in via POP->Tasks->Receipts.

This leaves 98 to be booked in which we can do via POP->Tasks->Receipts.

We have had an invoice for the 150 total here but this will not match against the PO receipted.

How can we have the 22 that have been booked in incorrectly, receipted against the PO?  So that Quantity received would match the invoice from the supplier.


Would the best way going forward be to book all items received against the PO and if any work required work on them, then that item gets issued to the works order until completed or is there a better way for this.

There is no possibility of an AD trust being in place either. For all intents and purposes, these workstations may as well be workgroup machines in this scenario. 

I've installed our Sage 1000 client onto one of these workstations and ensured it has connectivity to the system at the network layer. It can also resolve DNS without issue and the client can attempt to launch. The failure comes during the server connection with this error:
 

 

The error is a 401 unauthorised when accessing the web URL. 

On a good known working PC, a wireshark trace shows the initial 401 occur, but a follow up challenge and response happens which takes my current logged in AD username and password and sends it over. This happens transparently. 

 

On this workgroup PC, only the first two entries occur.

 


So I understand at this point that the web service is not getting the credentials it needs in the background automatically, because this workgroup machine is obviously not logged in on the same domain etc. 

I have found looking around in configs and logs that there are references to NTLM settings. For example net.properties contains these, although changing any of them doesn't seem to have any effect. 
 

Is there a parameter or configuration line available somewhere that would allow the client when launched to prompt the user to enter some credentials prior to it's attempt to connect to the /clientconnect/clientrequest.asmx URL ? 

If I manually browse to this url in Edge, I do get the challenge and can proceed, so a more manual authentication can work in the browser. Can the actual client do anything similar to overcome this ?

New invoices and credit notes are automatically given a Status of 10. The first digit of the status is automatically updated as the purchase invoice/credit note progresses through . The second digit can be changed manually. The first digit of the status can be set to one of the following values:

2 – on hold, that is, it has been returned to the invoicing department

I connected but found no lock was in place, Tim had already resolved.

To resolve the program holding the batch on the server needs to exit.
It appears in this instance Sage has realised it was no longer connected and has exited by itself (In my experience this tends to be around 30 minutes or 60 minutes before programs will exit).

t6UJ9A00FK0M,,PO - invoices questions,1,"have a couple of questions:

1)	How can I reliably find if a PO line is invoiced or not? I found a few columns on the scheme.podetm table: inv_qty_to_date, inv_value_posted, tran_inv_qty, that seem to do this but I am not sure which one (if any) is the best to achieve this.
2)	For a PO, how are the [unall_amount] or the [currency_amount] columns calculated (they have the same value), on [scheme].[plitemm] table? I am looking at PO  –  2023_1250 and I can see the value of -56334.6, but I checked the PO detail screen from Sage with my colleagues and the values in there (at a line by line level) don't add up to this in any way. I can't see any other value in the tables I checked ([poheadm], podetm, plitemm, pophstm)

If you need more details please let me know.","Usually the best way to check if an order has been invoiced is to compare then qty_ordered, qty_received to the qty_invoiced. If the order has been raised, receipted and then invoiced with full quantities Sage should set the podetm.status = 'C'  and populated date_completed. However an order can be invoiced before it's receipted. In this scenario Sage doesn't flag the line as 'C' it will remain at 'R'
 
You should have an entry in pophstm that records all POP invoices. These can be linked back to the podetm line. There may be many receipt line matched to many invoice lines so you'll need to group these. The pophst table will also record the VAT which isn't in the podetm table.
 
The columns in plitemm are:
Local_amount is the total invoice value (including VAT) in base currency 
Currency_amount is the total invoice value (including VAT) in the suppliers currency. If the supplier currency is the same as the Sage base currency these amounts will be the same.
Unall_amount is the unpaid amount of the invoice. Initially this will be the same as local_amount but as payments are made this value will be reduced by these payment amounts. Reaching 0.00 when the invoice has been totally paid. The open_indicator will be set to 'C' at this point.
Unall_curr_amt is the same as unall_amount but in the supplier currency.
 
The values in plitemm should match the values in pophstm (including VAT)"

t6UJ9A00FK7S,,SAGE/VPN Issues,3,"Good morning all,

I am hoping that you may be advise me on an issue that we a few people have reported.
As you may be aware, SIS have made some changes to the VPN in terms of security. Since then there have been three people that have been constantly had issues.

These range from:

- Sage crashing the whole computer
- Sage freezing on the random pages
- Error message: A communications error has occurred. Press OK to terminate this application
- Error message: Failed to contact web service

This has occurred when the VPN is still connected, as the users can still access the folders on the network drives.
The only way that the issues seem to be resolved is by rebooting the device.

Things that I have tried:
- Closing re-opening SAGE through 
- Disconnecting/re-connecting their wifi
- Re-installing SAGE
- Re-installing the VPN

This issue is only when working from home, and only 3 users.
I have potentially resolved one of them by connecting them to the MK VPN, since I done that there have been no issues with SAGE reported. However, I have given them added permissions without approval to test my thoughts out.
Unfortunately, 2 of the three users are in the office so I can't confirm the workaround for the time being.

Do you know of any logs files that I can check that might record disconnects or errors?
Also, If you have any suggestions or thoughts, please let me know.

Appreciate that there is a lot of info here, so if you would prefer a call to go through it, let me know.

t6UJ9A00FK8R,Performance,Slow SQL,3,"Hi 

Hope all well.

We've been chasing a slow SQL server this morning with no luck.  There are no slow queries in activity monitor, sp_whoisactive etc not giving us anything to go on either.  A fresh pair of eyes for 10 minutes on our SQL server would be appreciated if someone could remote on with me.

Realise it is short notice, and we'll likely restart the server over the weekend if we don't get a resolution which I know will cure it, but I'd rather catch it in the act and find the root cause.

For your info, I believe the midnight spike is datalinx batch and pallet match running over night – it runs from midnight to 7am, and normally any high cpu would drop right off at 7am.  Its as if SQL has held onto resources it doesn't need any more but isn't showing any evidence of needing those resources via query monitor etc.",Looked into this with Andrew and made some changes to the CPU configuration and investigated some queries agaisnt the STQUEM table coming out of Datalinx.

Our UK  believed that the European side of Fox could only view, not amend, UK Fox customers. This would mean access to customer enquiry screens without the ability to create or amend records. However, we recently found that EU customers were created in the UK entity, and a credit note was issued in June, suggesting the current access controls might not be as intended.

To ensure that the Belgium sales team only has enquiry access to UK entities and full control over EU entities, we need to review and possibly revise their security group access. Specifically, we need the Belgium sales team to have full create and amend control for EU entities while restricting their access to enquiry-only for UK entities.

For example, Jbloggs from the Belgium sales team should have create and amend access for FoxBE but only enquiry access for FoxUK. This requirement extends to both the UK and EU Preston entities as well.

Please can we review the security group access for several members of the EU sales team. If necessary, create a new security group that enables the required access controls. Our goal is to ensure that only the UK team can create and amend UK customer records.","Referring back to projects for John to look at on Monday when back from holiday.

I hope you are all well. I was just hoping to query Java versions in relation to allowing our version of Sage to run. 
 
We are currently using Sage ERP 1000 v4.0  9. We have historically tried to update Java clients and had issues where we have had to rollback as the sage client will not run unless it is using specifically Java version 8 update 381. 
 
Is this a known problem/ issue with the version we are using or are there any workarounds we can put in place to upgrade our Java version without breaking this instance of Sage? The current version of Java we are using has been identified as a vulnerability.","The information I have from Sage, states your version of Sage will only run between Java 1.8.0_144 up to 1.8.0_191 (Version 8 Patch 144 to 191).
Unfortunately, we only have your version tested up to Patch 191.

The recommendation is currently to upgrade Sage L1000 V3 and V4 to their latest service packs (Unfortunately it’s a bit more complex than installing a patch and therefore would require consultancy).
This replaces the Java client with one that has Java embedded, therefore no longer relies on Java being installed seperatly.

Hope you're well.

I just wanted to drop a note to see if you had anytime next week to discuss some potential ways we can make our intercompany transactions simpler.

We currently have transactions between the UK and US entities and multiple intracompany account code set up within SAGE. We raise sales invoices in the UK to the US and then have to raise the opposite in the US (purchase invoices to the UK) every month.

We also receive cash from a US customer to our UK account, which then each month needs to be posted to the US sales ledger, which involves posting multiple journal entries.

Any support would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,",Will park this request for now and revisit should the need arise.

This is the first time I have tried to update any forms at Zyro since you migration from Sage 1000 v3.0 to Sage 1000 v4.0 SP11 Patch 4. 

The form that I am trying to update is the customer maintenance (2nd Page). 
Based on the details it should be Form set : ZYRO, sl, customer_maint, page2
I wanted to configure a translation in the field account_type where a number is translated to a valid value for the user. 
I have setup this value using the Sage forms editors and this value is correctly displayed as a drop down in Sage with the options. 

 

The field on the form is too short of the display as it was initially only given a small box on the form, but I increase the size of the box (the same as I do with RVF forms in France). 
This is however not displayed or updated if I log back into Sage and open the form. 

I have tested this by updating the label of the  in the form being edited to be “Account-Type” and that is now shown in Sage.

At RVF when I want to update a form I use the  and I can modify the form. 

 



 if I go into the  I don’t get any forms to edit and missing the green box around the form.  
I know that you needed to do a form conversion as part of the migration that gives you the green box round the form but not sure if this was done at the time when the upgrade was completed.

We have accounts in Sage that are customers of our Ultrapanel business and some Ultrapanel customers only pay the invoice for an order once the product is installed. This doesn't really map to the current Sage process, so we'd like if possible, to amend the sales order despatch/invoice process just for these accounts. Currently for all customers an order is despatched in WMS and then immediately invoiced on the next invoice run. For selected Ultrapanel customers we'd like an order to be despatched but not then invoiced and instead then the next status would be installed which would be manually updated by someone here. Once an order is installed it would then be invoiced at the next invoice run. Please could you advise if this change is possible and what would be involved?

Kind regards,","Advised on suspending order by going into  option once WMS has despatched order to status 7.  Then once installation has complelted can then unsuspend order ready for invoicing.

As per yesterday's production issue, I feel this has something to do with batches on Raw materials in sage.

A few points below that we must do regularly:

	Extracted grass  has been an issue recently and we must increase the stock as DSL doesn't have an interface with raw materials booked in.
	We normally add either stock or increase the expiry date.
	Perhaps we didn't put enough expiry date on or perhaps increased the quantity too much.
	However, this did work yesterday and 2 weeks ago, but seems to have a delay approx. 1-2 hours before we can receipt pallet labels.

I have emailed also to Datel to log a ticket and perhaps between you – could you please have a look as we don't want production to stop as we cant print labels.

t6UJ9A00FCNT,,SAGE 1000 ERP Housekeeping process,3,",

We get regular requests from our team at ABSN to run Housekeeping on the database in Sage 1000 ERP to clear stock inaccuracies. This involves us removing all users from the system and only allowing one user in to perform the housekeeping tasks.
If any other users sign in and start performing other tasks this can interfere with the housekeeping and mean it needs to start again from the beginning, which can be very time consuming. This means it also requires someone from our app support team to be on hand and monitor the activity report to ensure nobody logs in, and remove them if they do.
The team at ABSN have asked can we do this on a once a week basis now as their productivity has increased and they are now seeing more inaccuracies than they previously did. In the past this has been ad hoc but maybe averaged once a month.
Doing this once a week is time consuming and takes up  a lot of our resource. We were wondering is there any way to automate or streamline this process to enable the users to do the housekeeping once a month but without the need to take up our app support resources?
We would be happy to have a call to discuss this in more detail.


Regards,","I have checked with my colleagues and the guidance was issued when Tetra CS/3/ 500 used flat files for most of its data instead of SQL databases.
As you run  1000 on MSSQL, the stock recalc program reads and writes records one at a time. It will issue commands to SQL therefore only one record can be written at a time avoiding data integrity/corruption issues.
None of my colleagues are aware of any data corruption or data integrity issues whilst  1000 is run from a database such as Microsoft SQL Server.
You are fine to run stock recalc on individual stock items, it is recommended you advise users not to use affected stock items in Sales/Purchase/, Bill of Materials or amending the Stock details so you don’t get stock in use messages.
If the items are mainly for production and not used for Sales, you may be able to directly ask your production team rather than all Sage users (Also to consider is the warehouse, if a production team at a specific site uses a specific set of warehouses you will only need to contact that production team).

Ultimately this will be your decision, if you would like to look at automation I can pass this to your account manager."

A new support issue

Problem : 
We have an issue whereby our users are POP Invoicing more than has been received which is not what we want.  To change the system to try and prevent the users invoicing more than has been received on the p/order it appears would mean quite a number of changes:

Our system key POINVTOLQN    is currently set to YES                                      (Allow invoicing if none received)
From the details of the system key it specifies that the projects DA0404 and DA0533 need to be enabled and these are currently switched off.
To progress turning on the projects we would then need to check with VI Software that this would be possible, and then setting up all the bits for those projects.

As this is a big change to implement we are therefore wondering if it is possible that to help with this issue we could to add the   information onto the Invoicing screen (see screendump below) – so the users know whats been received. 

However, I have tried this (tried values : qty_received and received_quantity)  and it just ignores them.  The code may have the field value so it could be that they are called something different but need to check with Datel (suspect that the option doesn't allow this information and we have possibly tried this). Form used is :(Po / po_invoice_entry / po_details) See details below.


 

 

BRegards

Hazell",",

I’ve checked with a couple of colleagues, and I can say that we don’t believe that there is a conflict between the VI functionality (cfpoinv) and the Sage projects DA0403 and DA0533 when they are activated as we haven’t had any support tickets raised in this area.

We would recommend testing in demo initially and if you do require any assistance, we may have to refer this to your  to quote for some consultancy time as these are not ‘small’ projects to implement."

Please can I log a call?
 
On our customer returns module is a system key determining what price we bring the goods back into stock at ?  We believe this is currently applying the standard cost, but I need this confirming and if that can be changed.
 
 
Regards","I believe the system key which controls this is AQRETNCOST, if this is set to YES this also depends upon the system key STGRNVAL which can also be set to STANDARD.

:
A  consists of the following sections:

 - this allows you to create and maintain a returns log to track and record units when they are returned.
 - this section allows you to view and amend details associated with the Customer code entered for the 'current'  providing that the system key AQNEWCUST is set to YES. Note that any changes made on this form are for the current  only, no amendments are made to the customer files. If permanent changes are required, the relevant customer files maintenance options should be used.
 - allows you to record each item that is to be processed.
 - allows you to enter details of the items returned. An automatic stock transaction is created in the Stock table when the quantity received is processed. System key AQRETNCOST determines the costing method used for the returned stock.


:
AQRETNCOST:	This key is used when returning goods to stock. Type YES if you wish  to be costed using the costing method defined in system key STGRNVAL. Type NO if  are costed at Standard cost.
STGRNVAL:	 - Standard, Current, Expected or Zero.

This key determines how your goods inward are valued.

If you type STANDARD, the standard material, labour, overhead and sub-contracting costs will be recorded in the batch record when the item is booked into stock. If your screen has been set up to show the cost breakdown, the full cost details will be displayed. Otherwise, the total standard cost only will be displayed.

If you type CURRENT and your system has been set up to show the cost breakdown, the current material, labour, overhead and subcontracting costs will be entered automatically. If your system is not set up to show the cost breakdown, only the total current cost will be displayed.

Type ZERO if costs are to be set to zero when a batch is booked in.

Type EXPECTED to use the cost you expect to pay for this item.

If the key is set to EXPECTED then the incoming batch value will be based on the purchase order price as recorded in the  program. This key is also read by the  module to update the expected cost in the supplier detail information."

Company:  Vimto UKP (sysvsd)
 
We have an order that is at status 9 Deleted, but we are unable to explain why or how this order has been deleted.
 
When looking at the order via sales order tracking it looks to have been deleted via the api, see below:
 
 
 
 
I've also noticed the tracking shows the order was entered, the status changed and then deleted all at the same date/time.
 
This order was received via EDI directly into Sage, was picked up by our automated job at 11:00 and sent over to our 3PL for them to deliver the goods.  This automated job only picks up orders at status 4, so I am assuming at 11:00 on 20/03/24, the order was at status 4.
 
It was only at the point of receiving the file back from the 3PL to dispatch the order that we found the order being at a status of deleted.
 
Could you please take a look into this and advise.

 McGinn",",

I have been looking at using the ‘sales despatches by customer’ (SDBC) option in inventory in the Demo. Unfortunately, it does not appear to work as described. The issues are as follows:

•	The default transaction number cannot be amended to the  number as there is only room for five characters.  have six characters.
•	The reference field where the sales order is entered when using the SDBC option does not pull into  in Sage. Consequently the user needs to add the SO in the comments section of the SDBC to ensure there is a traceable reference in stock histories.
•	Whilst the option does down date stock, it does not close the SO. Therefore the product demand still shows as being required in Sage. Obviously, this is a major issue.

We seem to have an issue where the shipper_code3 field on the opheadm is not being populated on some orders.

The shipper_code3 holds the username of the person who processes the order.

We were running out of AA order numbers so had to move to AB order numbers – this happened a few weeks ago.

Many thanks,","We would do is take a copy of the file invoices_1000.def for backup and then make the change when no-one is printing invoices.
Looking at the change to this, the only risk I can see is making the change whilst invoices are printed. If there is an issue the backed up invoices_1000.def would be moved back.
 
I would advise after the change to reprint an affected invoice and double check the settlement discount prints correctly.

Any issues return the backup definition file back and log a call with us referencing this call."

We need to hijack 3 sales codes and their equivalent COS code for SACO products. Please can you have a look at the attached and see if there is a logical choice or preference?

The three categories are:

Once decided we would need to look at all the  we have and apply the correct code into a (s) so that when the invoices are generated the correct code is applied.

t6UJ9A00F5W6,,,3,"Hi
 
Please can I log a call.
 
We have a purchase order that has printed with the correct information we would have expected, and this has been attached to this email.   However, the purchase or detail lines in Sage do not reflect the purchase order that has printed.
 
The values are completely different (much higher)  as a result this has created a negative margin on a sales order that has been invoiced.
 
I have checked the PO detail audit table, but this has nothing in it.   Is there any other way of finding out how this may have been changed.  Aside from this do we have a way of correcting this in Sage for the PO and Sales order associated with the products sold from the purchase order?
 
 
Regards","From the receipt side it looks like the PO line details have been updated at the receipt point to match the invoice value (batch QV3S78) but this has been adjusted out, so this batch no longer shows in the stquem (Batch table). The po_detail_lines table is audited but ONLY on the required date value not the expected cost or foreign expected cost, but the current value for each item is 12.95 Euro.

To remove the -ve margin on the order the only way is:-

1, credit the invoice which will then return the items to stock (OPCNSTOCK system key is set to YES)
2, via batch maintenance control amend the cost on the batches to what you think they should be.
3 re invoice the order selecting the returned batches which will then reduce the stock and the cost on the sales order invoice, re-instating the expected margin on the order

If you have any questions, please drop me an email and I’ll give you a call when convenient."

The first thing I can see is that the VM-SAGEDB server only has 16Gb memory available and currently SQL is consuming some 13Gb of memory keeping the memory at 90+% all the time which could have an impact on the performance. In screen shot 4 it appears that the SQL is not limited into the amount of memory it can use as this would usually be fixed at 60% of the available memory i.e. 9.6Gb.The setting can be updated but would only take affect following a server reboot.

The recommendation would be to give the SQLDB server more memory e.g. 32Gb and set the SQL limit to 20Gb giving some 12Gb for all other apps on the server then reboot the SQL server, please note any app server connecting to the SQLDB would need to be shutdown prior to the database server, re-boot the DB server then bring the other app servers back on-line."

t6UJ9A00F3XM,,Prior year adjustment,3,"Hello
I hope you can assist with a query I have. 
For our financial year ended 31 Dec 2022 our auditors gave us a journal to post as below: 

It now transpires that the final line for £1,005,732.93 should in fact have been posted to the P&L and not to reserves. (The bulk of it is to E-01-050-02-11, we are just finding out where the rest should go to). This is causing us some issues when we come to report our 31 Dec 2023 numbers, with opening reserves and the prior year profit being incorrect in Sage. 
Is there any way, now we have already closed off 2022 adjustment period, to correct the journal? We don't want the adjustment to impact 2023 profit. 
 
 
Please can you copy my colleagues Julia and Paul into any reply.

I have been through with Jane, the project is more date based, I don’t think will offer much help above the standard Sage functionality.
Jane has recommended to utilise the Supersessions on the raw material itself, using an estimated date when you would believe you will swap to the new raw material to move to the new material.
For the example above I have set a supersession on the BRAKE component but not amended the BOM. Operators will need to go through the amended line for the supersession box to appear.
I would recommend adding a detail comment field (Warehouse d with a blank product) advising which stock items are being replaced.
The operator can then escape and continue to use the existing component (In this instance BB BRAKE) or use the  to Accept the supersession obviously replaces that stock item when creating the works order.
Once you have exhausted the older stock, update the BOM (Sage again will pop up and show the product has been superseded, press enter to accept).
It might be worth testing this in your demo company to see if this would work."

t6UJ9A00F1ZE,,posting in the NL,3,",
 
I have a query regarding a posting in the NL on our International company, (sysint) and would appreciate some help.
 
The transaction no is CB00000981 for .81.
 
I cannot see this transaction on the system log for August 23 which is the date of the posting.  Also, there is another posting for the same no with a posing period of 12 year 14
 
See below screenshot:
 
 
 
It looks like the system has generated an old transaction reference, as another CB journal in August is numbered CB00001266.
 
We have checked the bank statement and the value has gone through the bank so is a genuine transaction, but the journal number is incorrect.
 
This has been picked up during some sample testing by the auditors.
 
Could you please take a look and advise.

t6UJ9A00F0YV,,Error HRE SULT E_FAIL has been returned froma  call to a COM component,3,"This isn't new, been around for a long time. We deal with it by restarting the . But until this is done, this error pops up for everyone attempting to launch Sage 1000. I always considered it to be a result of a server restart and the Staging point service launching before a necessary com component was ready for it.  But setting it to delayed start didn't improve it.

So, i added a delay routing, give it 10 mins after a restart before launching the service. Still sometimes this error resulted, sometimes not, same as before.

Obvious answer is don't restart the server. But we find that if the server runs for a few weeks without a restart then this happens anyway, or at least another similar error preventing launching until the service is restarted. Plus we need to keep the server patched, and that requires automated restarts out of hours. So this isn't an option or a solution.

I have noticed that when restarting this service, all the orphaned sessions are automatically closed too, so last week i had the bright idea of restarting the service at 04:45 daily to hopefully kill two birds with one stone, close orphaned sessions and prevent the eventual failure and all without a full restart. But this morning i happened to check it and couldn't open Sage. Giving the same error.

Checked all windows logs, nothing terribly helpful but did find this at the same time as the service restart this morning:

""The application-specific permission settings do not grant  permission for the COM Server application with CLSID
{D63B10C5-BB46-4990-A94F-E40B9D520160}
 and APPID
{9CA88EE3-ACB7-47C8-AFC4-AB702511C276}
 to the user BSG\SVC-GER-CSUSER1000 SID (S-1-5----) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the  administrative tool.""


But this isn't uncommon in the logs and not always specific to when it is acting up. Can see some references to the service terminating unexpectedly and restarting a few time in succession, particulary yesterday, but there were no reported issues yesterday.

Although a blue moon event normally with the server set to restart weekly, it is grating on the finance teams especially when they come in early to start period end and can't access Sage until IT are available to restart the service. The current setup of daily service restart i will now change to weekly as i'm likely now increasing the random frequency of failures. 

If the service failed outright i could probably come up with a workaround, but it doesn't fail. It runs, apparently gleefully so. But randomly you can open sage and other times nobody can, until the service is restarted.

Searching online i can only find references of this error to Sage 300 and the resolutions are not that helpful when attempting to apply it to 1000.

Is there anything Datel can do to make this problem go away? I'm truly out of ideas now

When we receive invoices from supplier we go to 
FINANCE
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE
TASKS
INVOICES

We then send all invoices to Authorisers for review. Invoices are effectively identified by authorisers initials.


When we receive authorisation for all invoices without PO we go into

We effectively enter the authorisers initials
And POST All those invoices that have been authorised.

If we have received authorised invoices with PO's
We go into

PO PROCESSING
TASKS
PURCHASE INVOICES
We select next batch
To match the invoice to the PO, we are forced to enter the invoice no, but with a 'slash' on the end of the invoice number as it is effectively a duplicate reference no.

We then need to do the AUTHORISED INVOICE POSTING.
Via 
FINANCE
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

Only invoices without slashes appear and these are the ones that we POST.


We believe that we have to enter slashes against all those invoices that have a PO, as it is the only way to match the invoice to the PO with the present methodology employed.


Please can you advise if there is a better way that would effectively mean that no invoice numbers with slashes need to be entered.","Tim explained the previous finance clerk who had done the job for 20 years had left, it appears instructions provided needed one tweak.

You have 1 Sage company with a UK and US base. There is one stock module that identifies stock between these 2 location. You currently have a considerable stock value in the US but this is on your UK balance sheet. Moving forwards you want to ‘sell’ the UK stock to your US operation with a 4% uplift in stock cost.

Please could you confirm how you currently ‘move’ the stock from the UK to US.

I’ve discussed your requirements with a couple of colleagues and I feel that you could achieve this stock movement by either utilising the EDI functionality or possibly the  orders. It may also be possible with the Automation client also. 
As there isn’t a standard Sage project or module to help you achieve this it will require some further discussions so I have referred this to your  @ to progress.

 costing system keys show that you’re using ‘CURRENT’ costing which may be an issue with any ‘front-end’ solution as the PO won’t pick up the batch cost. Automation or our PO API may be the solution to this.

I think the old VAT code was CIC and we changed it to CDM to mirror Axil which works.

The invoices are sat in the spool queue as waiting and so in theory we can just “print to file”.

IT Manager","I have had a quick look and from the error it is picking up more than 1 value from the contract_vUnitsSyncView.
I have checked the view and see that it is returning multiple duplicate which normally means you have more than one company which are copies from you  live ERP DB.
This will cause issues as if a copy of Live is taken and the views not recreated it returns duplicate values.

Looking only at your current issue the following is shown in the log.
<sdata:message>More than one row with the given identifier was found: TIN                           , for class: Sage1000.Gobi.V3Contract.Contract_vUnits</sdata:message>

So when it runs the SELECT on csviews.sync.contract_vunitssyncview  it finds duplicates for TIN
 

All of these have a modify date of 17th – Jan – 2024

The correct way to fix this is for the Sage1000 team to run a manual process to clear down and rebuild the views just with the Sage ERP Live database data as at present your view are looking at the following:
 

NOTE this is not  just affecting the contract_vUnitsSyncview.
Every other view will be the same.

The quick fix maybe to remove the Unit – TIN from Newtest and Test which I assume are test Sage ERP companies.

Since we closed the year end for one of our companies, there now seems to be an error when we are trying to create credit transfer payment uploads from SAGE to the bank. 

Although SAGE shows a due and this is selected in the create payment list option and visible when you modify the payment list in SAGE, when you dpprint the run to create an upload to HSBC, the balance shows as zero rather than the due balance owed. 

Can you investigate urgently please. 

Please note. we are not aware if this is going to also be an issue on the other companies as we are yet to raise credit transfer payments on the other companies.

So long as your Sage system does not print via that File/Print server then you are go.
That means all definitions via V1 and any reporting that you send to the Sage server do not go via or to the File/Print server.
I would however keep it on when the new server comes into play however as soon as you migrate, and things stop printing then you will know – maybe better to wait after !
But it should be ok.
If you need us to go through every definition in V1 you have then it would require consultancy and I would need to refer you to Melissa your  to provide other resource.

Looking for a bit of insight, please

Our payroll team had an issue last week where they had to roll back the payroll in Sage50, but when they tried to repost the timesheets from Sage1000 it wouldn't allow them to do so as they had already been posted once.
As they were against the clock, and this happened after your support desk had closed, they ended up re-keying all of the timesheet details into Sage50 manually.

Hopefully, this won't happen again, but just in case, I was wondering if it would have been possible for you to reset the timesheets' status in the Sage1000 tables, so that they could have been reposted?

I am hoping you can help. 

For the aged debtors report we have an option enabled to run the report in a retrospective manner, which has been very useful for us.
We now need this for the aged creditors report, but I cannot see the option available, may this be enabled please.

Regarding the aged creditors report, we have an issue that I am hoping can be resolved by this method. An error has occurred where we have created a payment run in the form of a bacs report, which we completed last week, but in error the cash has been posted to January, before we have closed off Dec'23 PL period and more importantly, our year end.

Because of this error, both our aged creditors and open cash (cash audit trail) will be incorrect at year end. I do not know if there is a way to directly target and revert activities on the system log relating to supplier posted cash payments but would be the best fix for us. If not, the request/question I have relating to the aged creditors is:- With the retrospective options through aged debtors/creditors, is it taking a snapshot of the system at that calendar day, or is it a retrospective look at the customer/supplier table at that point in time?

The reason I ask is that if it is a snapshot at the system period, then it will run 31st December and will not be accurate for us as our purchase ledger side is not yet closed. If this looks directly at supplier info and excludes posted invoices/cash after that date range, then it will give us a correct aged creditors report, which is what we are looking for.

Please can you let me know the available options you can help with. In terms of desired outcomes, we would much prefer the payment batches (attached) be reversed out so our year end position is correct, otherwise we would like a retrospective aged creditors list that excludes this change in our supplier balances.

On 22nd June 2023 stock card C11609 was created. 
On the card was part 6165 AF. Expected stock was 33, however 20pcs were allocated and were therefore on the shopfloor waiting to be assembled.
The stock counted was 13 and this figure was entered into SAGE when the stock check was posted on the 23rd June.
All other parts on this stock card show the adjustment made on the 23rd June except for part 6165 AF. The stock history file does however show the 20pcs being allocated.

We have a discrepancy between the total sales on the sales summary and the total sales as per the G/L in December.

I have managed to trace the discrepancy to the below 2 credit notes:

 

 

 

I'm not sure what has happened with these, but they both show as 'Invoiced', but there have been no credit notes raised on the respective debtor accounts.

As such you will need to try to re-create these credit notes (if required), but I am not sure if you will be able to use the same order number now – might be worth checking with Datel to see why these 2 didn't make it all the way through to the debtors ledger.
